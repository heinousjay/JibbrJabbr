JibbrJabbr is an experiment in Java HTTP server concepts.

Requires JDK 7 and you'll probably want Maven.

Doesn't do a whole heck of a lot, yet.  Run the build,
put target/jj-0.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar in a directory
somewhere, then run

$JDK7_HOME/bin/java -jar jj-0.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar

in that directory.
