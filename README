JibbrJabbr is an experiment in Java HTTP server concepts.

Requires JDK 7 and you'll probably want Maven 3 (although it should build on 2).

Doesn't do a whole heck of a lot, yet.  Run the build,
put JibbrJabbr-server/JibbrJabbr/target/JibbrJabbr-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar in a directory
somewhere, then run

$JDK7_HOME/bin/java -jar JibbrJabbr-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar

and browse to

http://localhost:8080
