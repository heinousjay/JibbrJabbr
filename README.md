JibbrJabbr
==========

An experiment in Java HTTP server concepts.
-------------------------------------------

Requires [JDK 7](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html)
and you'll probably want [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org).
Maven 2 also works, for now.

Doesn't do a whole heck of a lot, yet.  Run the build,
put JibbrJabbr-server/JibbrJabbr/target/JibbrJabbr-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar in a directory
of your choosing, then run

`$JDK7_HOME/bin/java -jar JibbrJabbr-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar /path/to/your/test/directory`

and browse to

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
